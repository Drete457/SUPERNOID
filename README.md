# SUPERNOID

We are students of a Portuguese code academy.

After 4 weeks of learning, we made our first team project whose goal was to make a game with java and a simple gfx library. We had 1 week to work on it and present a jar file.

The project was a lot of work, but the end result was very satisfying and rewarding.
